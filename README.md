# Flesh and Blood Cards

## General Overview
This repo is intended as a comprehensive, open-source resource for representing all cards and sets from the Flesh and Blood TCG as CSVs.

The CSVs are tab delimited and use " as string indicators.

Please feel free to clone or fork the repo and generally use it for whatever projects you like. I put this together so the community doesn't have to
keep re-entering the same data! I would absolutely appreciate any contributions if you notice any missing data or mistakes. :)

You can view the current CSVs through the web [here](https://the-fab-cube.github.io/flesh-and-blood-cards/).


## Approach to reprints/editions
This repo treats a unique card (name + pitch value) as 1 entity. A unique card can have multiple printings, foils, editions, etc, but is considered 1 entry in the CSVs.

A card's text and other data will always be based off the latest erratas and printings.

Similarly, a set is unique based on a setcode + name, and can have multiple editions, but is considered to be 1 entry within the CSV.


## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please take a look at the format below to see how various CSV fields should be formatted, and then open a PR for any changes you'd like to make.

The list of open milestones that have card data that needs entering can be found [here](https://github.com/flesh-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards/milestones)

I have LibreOffice files in the repo for easy editing in open-office. It is okay if you do not use them, I will update them with any changes other people make without using LibreOffice,
but they are there for convenience. To use them, just open the .ods file and edit, and then when done, export the file as a .csv to the csvs folder with Save As, making sure to
choose Tabs as the delimiter and " as the string indicator.

## Current Status on CSV Representation of Translated Cards
If you are interested in helping transcribe the History Pack 1 Black Label cards, please comment [here](https://github.com/the-fab-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards/issues/118) to register your interest and I'll get in touch with you when efforts are ready to begin!


## Generate HTML Viewable CSVs

### Install csvtotable
`pyenv install`

`pyenv exec pip install --upgrade csvtotable`

### Serve a specific file
`pyenv exec csvtotable {file}.csv --serve -d $'\t' -q $'"`

### Generate all HTMLs
`./generate-htmls.sh`

## Auto incrementing Image URL values in OpenOffice
1. Go to cell you want to copy URLs of (in our case, Image URLs, which is U8 for us)
2. In an empty column in the same row (in our case, V8), add the card number (for us, 6, since we're starting on WTR6)
3. Go to the next empty column in the same row (in our case, W8), and copy\paste this formula in
    ```=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE($X$8,"WTR006",CONCATENATE("WTR", TEXT(Y8, "000"))),"WTR6",CONCATENATE("WTR", Y8)),"WTR_6",CONCATENATE("WTR_", Y8))```
4. Replace the WTR006, WTR6, WTR_6 values in the formula with the set number you're trying to increment, and replace the instances of $U$8 and V8 with your cell values
5. Drag copy the cells - you should see your formula cell have the proper URLs!
6. Highlight and copy the new cells from the column you generated with formulas
7. Highlight the actual cells you want the URLs in (since they're all copies of the original URL right now)
8. Right click, select Paste Special > Paste Special..., and click Values Only
9. Delete your temporary columns, and you're done!
10. Note: You can use something like this for Variations: `SUBSTITUTE($W$8,"WTR006",CONCATENATE("WTR", TEXT(Y8, "000")))`
